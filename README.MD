### Usage

```
For IntelliJ just clone the project, set JDK to 1.8 (the most steady for GWT)
Run/Debug Configurations are in img/Screenshot_6.png
and don't forget to install the GWT plugin for IntelliJ

For Eclipse it is almost the same.
NetBeans - I don't know
Notepad too.


```

It is in development stage, so look forward for future features and don't care about the bugs, this is my first web app in GWT ;P:

```
Future TODO is -> much to do
```
